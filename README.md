Ancient Trees Conservation Genomics Analysis Scripts

This repository contains analysis scripts used in an ongoing population-scale whole-genome study focused on conservation genomics and evolutionary importance.

The scripts are organized into three main analytical modules:
 
Repository Structure

1_population_genetics
Scripts related to population genomic structure, demographic inference, and general population-level analyses.
 
2_genetic_diversity_load
Scripts for estimating genome-wide diversity patterns and assessing mutation burden–related metrics.
 
3_rare_allele_representation
Scripts for identifying and evaluating the representation of rare genetic variants across different conservation categories.
 
Notes
